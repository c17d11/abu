# 3D-models

# ABU-FULL
Full length fishing rod tip.

The length of the tip is shorter than the original since my 3D-printer is too
small.

## Printing tips
Use PETG when printing, it will make the tip flexible.


# ABU-MOUNT
Used fit a smaller tip to the fishing rod.
Print the model and then drill a hole that fist the other tip.

## Printing tips
Print with 100% infill if you are going to drill in the mount.
